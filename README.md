This is a sandbox and exercise collection used to  learn Typescript.

- The Module folders come from Microsoft's Introduction to Typescript course on EdX.org.
- Sandboxing is included here on starter.ts
- I used Atom's wonderful package for compiling Typescript on saves.

EdX's Typescript course (DEV201x) is [here](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:Microsoft+DEV201x+2015_T4/info).
